# PSY6422_Module_Project
Project for 'Data Analysis and Visualisation' module about the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on world happiness
Thanks for checking out my github page! 
This project takes a look how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted well-being in the world by analysing and visualising data from the World Happiness Reports from 2018 to 2023.
If you would like to see this project, check the webpage (the link is available through this repo).
If you would like to take this analysis forward, the data files and code used for this project are available in this repo too.

P.S. I'd love any feedback you have on my work. This was my first attempt at coding ever and I would like to have any feedback to help me learn more.
