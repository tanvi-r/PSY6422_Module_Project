The variables used/ calculated during wrangling and their explanations:

Country - Country names; the project used data of 130 Countires, others were excluded due to data unavailability

Regional indicator - World region that the country is part of, as per the World Happiness Report's categorization (10 Regions)

Year - Year in which the data was collected (6 years - 2017,2018,2019,2020,2021,2022)

Happiness score/ Ladder score - Life evaluation score based on the Gallup World Poll data gathered from each country; the scores provided by the WHR for each year are an average of that and the previous two years for e.g., the score for 2022 is an average of the scores for 2020, 2021 and 2022 for that country. 

avg_2017_2019 - Average Happiness Score calculated for 2017 to 2019

avg_2020_2022 - Average Happiness Score calculated for 2020 to 2022

mean_diff - Difference of means calculated for means of 2017-2019 and 2020-2022; calculated by subtracting the mean for 2017-2019 from the mean for 2020-2022 such that a positive value indicates increase and a negative value indicates decrease 

diff_pos - Variable values: TRUE / FALSE; if mean_diff > 0 = TRUE, if mean_diff < 0 = FALSE; used for color coding in the diverging barplot to indicate mean increase/ decrease
